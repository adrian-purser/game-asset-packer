GAP File Format
===============


Each line that is not empty or a comment contains a command. The structure of the command can be seen below -

<command>[,<parameter]...

where parameter is a key/value pair -

<key>[=<value>]

e.g.,

loadimage,src="test.png"

Note: The value is optional for certain parameters.

NAME                         The name that the file will be given in the package. If not specified then the
                             source filename will be used. There is a limit of 15 characters. A file extension
                             is not required.
TYPE                         The type of the file. This is a 4CC so there is a maximum 4 characters.


IMAGE
-----

Add an image to the current imagegroup. The image is taken as a subimage of the current source image if the subimage 
coordinates are specified, otherwise the whole source image is used.

X                            X coordinate in pixels of the top left of the source region within the parent image
Y                            Y coordinate in pixels of the top left of the source region within the parent image
W or WIDTH                   Width of the image source region in pixels. The output image width may differ if it is rotated or has empty regions removed.
H or HEIGHT                  Height of the image source region in pixels. The output image height may differ if it is rotated or has empty regions removed.
XO or XORIGIN                X Origin of the image in pixels. The image will be rendered with the origin placed at 
                             the specified coordinate. Rotations will use this as the origin of rotation. The final origin coordinate may differ after
                             any rotations have been applied.
YO or YORIGIN                Y Origin of the image in pixels. The image will be rendered with the origin placed at 
                             the specified coordinate. Rotations will use this as the origin of rotation. The final origin coordinate may differ after
                             any rotations have been applied.
ANGLE ot ROTATE              Angle in degrees to rotate the image. The image will be rotated around the origin specified by XO,YO. If COUNT and ANGLESTEP
                             are specified then ANGLE will represent the inition rotation.
ANGLESTEP *                  If COUNT is more than one, Add this value to the current rotation angle.
SCALE *                      Scale the image by the specified amount.
SCALESTE *                   If COUNT is more than one, Add this value to the current scale value.
HFLIP *                      Horizontal flip. The origin will also be flipped.
VFLIP *                      Vertical flip. The origin will also be flipped.
PF or FORMAT                 Pixel format pf the output image. If not specified then the format of the source image will be used.
NAME                         Name of the image so that it can be found by a search
COUNT *                      Generate 'COUNT' output images. Each image may be rotated or scaled differently if ANGLESTEP and/or SCALESTEP are specified.

* = Not currently implemented


IMAGEARRAY

dimensions and pixel format.

YO or YORIGIN                Y Origin of each image in pixels. The image will be rendered with the origin placed at the specified 
                             coordinate. Rotations will use this as the origin of rotation
XC or XCOUNT                 The width of the image array measured in number of images. This value multiplied by YC will determine 
                             the total number of images.
YC or YCOUNT                 The height of the image array measured in number of images. This value multiplied by XC will determine 
                             the total number of images.
PF or FORMAT                 Pixel format pf the output image. If not specified then the format of the source image will be used.
HFLIP                        Horizontally flip each image. 0 = noflip, >0 = flip
VFLIP                        Vertically flip each image. 0 = noflip, >0 = flip
